# MechaCar_Statistical_Analysis   

## Overview   
This analysis is to review data on the MechaCar's performance data.   

### Objectives   
* Find which variables closely predicts the MPG for vehicle prototypes.   
* Present summary statistics of the suspension coils' PSI.   
* Test if manufacturing lots have a statistically significant difference from the population's mean.      
* Propose a new study to compare the MechaCar's performance against other vehicles in the market.
